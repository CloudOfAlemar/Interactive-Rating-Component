# Interactive Rating Component
This component is from the Frontend Mentor Challenges. I decided to add
a heading towards the top and a little animation when displaying the
thank you pop up section after submitting the rating.

This is the first project that I'v published online from my local
computer and I'm super excited to complete and share more!

After publishing this component on the Frontend Mentor website, I've made sure to fix some accessibility issues as well as use the correct HTML semantic elements. I added label elements to their corresponding input elements.
